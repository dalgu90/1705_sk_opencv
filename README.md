# SK Academy Computer Vision Course Materials
A class material for SK Academy Computer Vision class(2017-05-25~26) 

## Tutorial index
1. OpenCV-Python Getting Started
2. Edge Detection
3. Object Classification with VBoW
4. Object Tracking(Python source files)

(Extra) Feature Extraction & Matching / Homograpy

## Note
This tutorial on OpenCV-Python is based on [OpenCV 3.2.0](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), which is not compatible to the previous 2.X. For example, feature extracting(SIFT, SURF, ...) is moved to the sub-module named `cv2.xfeatures2d` and you should install [opencv_contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib) to use this.
