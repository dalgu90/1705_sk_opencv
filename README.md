# opencv-tutorial
A short tutorial on OpenCV-Python

## Tutorial index
1. OpenCV-Python Getting Started
2. Edge Detection
3. Feature Extraction & Matching
4. Geometric Transformation & Homography
5. Face Detection with Cascade Classifier
6. Object Classification with VBoW
7. Object Tracking
8. (Practice Test) - SIFT Mosaic / Face & Eye Detection

## Note
This tutorial on OpenCV-Python is based on [OpenCV 3.2.0](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), which is not compatible to the previous 2.X. For example, feature extracting(SIFT, SURF, ...) is moved to the sub-module named `cv2.xfeatures2d` and you should install [opencv_contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib) to use this.
